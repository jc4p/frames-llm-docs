# Frames V2 LLM Instructions

This repository contains comprehensive instructions for implementing Farcaster Frames V2 in various project types. These files are designed to be used as context for LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to help them understand and assist with Frames V2 integration.

## Purpose

Drop these instruction files into your project and use them as context when asking an LLM to help you implement Frames V2 functionality. The LLM will be able to understand the context of how to create Frame V2 integrations based on these files.

## Instruction Files

This repository includes the following instruction files for different project types:

- [LLM_INSTRUCTIONS_vanilla_js.md](./LLM_INSTRUCTIONS_vanilla_js.md) - Instructions for implementing Frames V2 in a vanilla JavaScript project with a bundler
- [LLM_INSTRUCTIONS_nextjs.md](./LLM_INSTRUCTIONS_nextjs.md) - Instructions for implementing Frames V2 in a Next.js project
- [LLM_INSTRUCTIONS_static_html.md](./LLM_INSTRUCTIONS_static_html.md) - Instructions for implementing Frames V2 in a static HTML project without a bundler

Each file contains:
1. Specific setup instructions for that project type
2. Examples of how to import and use the SDK
3. Common patterns and best practices
4. A shared reference section with API details and common use cases
